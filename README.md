# haversine

Calculates distance between two geographical coordinates, using the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).

## CSharp

I used [this](https://megocode3.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/haversine-formula-in-c/) as a starting point, and made a few changes, mostly involving converting to extension methods.

I used [this](https://github.com/anthonyvscode/LonelySharp) as a starting point for the bounding coordinates calculations.

## Rust

I used [this](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/science/mathematics/trigonometry.html#distance-between-two-points-on-the-earth) as a starting point.  I moved some of the coordinate handling into a structure.
