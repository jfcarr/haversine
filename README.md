# haversine

Calculates distance between two geographical coordinates, using the [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula).

I used [this](https://megocode3.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/haversine-formula-in-c/) as a starting point, and made a few changes, mostly involving converting to extension methods.
